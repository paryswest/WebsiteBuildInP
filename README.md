# WebsiteBuildInP
SUPER AMATEUR website build with little pieces of things that I've learned from "CodeWithMosh"
As the description states, this is a SUPER DUPER basic randomized code that I've learned from "CodeWithMosh". This is the result; some are notes and follow along, but some of it is what I've accomplished on my own (i.e. the @keyframes and h1 class. Please take this with a SUPER piece of a grain of salt as I am a NOOB. Thanks!
